# Procrastinator motivator - React version

A motivational tool for procrastinators.

This tool will help you visualize the time you already lived (and possibly wasted) and the estimated life you have left.

Inspired by [this TEDTalk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU).

You can see it in work [here](https://thorgalaegirsson.github.io/Procrastinator-motivator-react)
